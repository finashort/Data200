# Data200
# My Github contains examples of my work from my Foundations of Data Analytics Class (DATA200), including an example RShiny application and a resume. Thank you to Kyle Monahan for providing the template used for my resume, which I hope highlights my skills as both a data analyst and aspiring foreign policy researcher.
